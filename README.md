# PassLock
#### PassLock, 2021.
#### By **Peter Kennedy**
## Description
A simple Python application to manage passwords using TDD with unittest.
A user can:
- Create a new user.
- Log in to an existing user (Username = `test` & Password = `t3st` for test data.)
- Remove a saved user.
  
When the user is logged in, they can:
- Add new credentials
- Store an existing credential in the passlock.
- View all the stored credentials.

- Log out.

The user also has an option of inputting a password or autogenerating a password by providing a password length.
